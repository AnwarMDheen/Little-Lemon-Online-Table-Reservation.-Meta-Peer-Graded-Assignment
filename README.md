# Little Lemon Restaurant - Reserve a Table Design Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Little Lemon Restaurant's "Reserve a Table" design project. This project was created as part of the Meta course on the Principles of UI/UX Design. The goal was to design a seamless table reservation experience for customers. The project includes user personas, customer journey maps, wireframes, and an interactive prototype, all created in Figma.

## User Persona

Understanding our users was a crucial step in this project. The user personas provide insight into our target audience's needs, goals, and pain points.

## Customer Journey Map

The customer journey map outlines the steps and touchpoints a user goes through when interacting with the Little Lemon Restaurant's reservation process. It helps visualize the user's experience and identifies areas for improvement.

## Wireframes

The wireframes serve as visual blueprints for the key pages of the website. These were created to guide the layout and structure of the design before adding any styling.

## Figma Prototype

The interactive prototype is a high-fidelity, clickable representation of the website. It allows users to experience the reservation process as designed.

## Usage

This project serves as a comprehensive reference for designing a reservation system. The .fig files can be opened and edited in Figma. They can be used to explore design decisions, understand the flow, or as a base for further development.

To open the files in Figma:

1. Download the .fig files from the repository.
2. Upload them to your Figma account by selecting `Import File` from the File menu.
